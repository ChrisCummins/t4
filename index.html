        <h3>Overview</h3>

<p>t4 is a tool for conveniently generating application tests as shell scripts. t4
consists of two components, the first an m4 macro library `t4.m4' which defines
a number of useful macros for writing test scripts. Using this library, a user
can create concise test scripts using a combination of regular shell syntax and
the t4.m4 macros. These user-created files are referred to as t4 files. The
second component, t4c, is a small program which generates executable shell
scripts from these t4 files. This is analogous to writing configure.ac files and
then using GNU Autoconf to generate configure scripts.</p>

<h3>Example file</h3>

<p>A very basic t4 file <code>hello-world.t4</code>:</p>

<pre><code># An example of a simple t4 file. The idea here is to merely demonstrate the
# most basic t4 usage.

# All t4 tests should begin with with the T4_INIT macro. This servers the
# purpose of including a lot of set up boiler plate, such as parsing command
# line options, and initialising a first test fixture. This macro should only be
# used once per test, and should be the first t4 macro used.
T4_INIT()

# Run the command `ls' and fail if it does not succeed. This is the bread and
# butter of any honest testing library, and will be used often.
OK([ls])

# Run the command `ls /path/to/nothing' and fail if it does succeed. The idea
# here is to give it a command that you know should fail under normal
# circumstances, and if it in fact succeeds, then this test fails. This form of
# assertion is useful for testing known breaking conditions, bad inputs, error
# cases etc.
NOK([ls /path/to/nothing])

# This wouldn't be a good example if it didn't print `Hello, World!'.
T4_PRINT([Hello, World!])
</code></pre>

<p>To compile, run and test:</p>

<pre><code>  $ t4c -v -o hello-world.t4
  t4c: generating 'hello-world.t4c'
  t4c: processing m4 file 'hello-world.t4c'
  t4c: removing m4 file 'hello-world.t4c'
  $ ls -l
  -rwxrwxr-x 1 chris chris  9745 Apr  5 01:49 hello-world
  -rw-rw-r-- 1 chris chris  1223 Apr  5 01:18 hello-world.t4
  $ ./hello-world
  Hello, World!
</code></pre>
