README for t4 0.0.1
==============================================================================

DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

t4 is a tool for conveniently generating application tests as shell scripts. t4
consists of two components, the first an m4 macro library `t4.m4' which defines
a number of useful macros for writing test scripts. Using this library, a user
can create concise test scripts using a combination of regular shell syntax and
the t4.m4 macros. These user-created files are referred to as t4 files. The
second component, t4c, is a small program which generates executable shell
scripts from these t4 files. This is analogous to writing configure.ac files and
then using GNU Autoconf to generate configure scripts.

See the `Documentation' directory for a description of the bundled t4
macros. Several example t4 files may be found in the `examples' directory.

REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

t4 has no dependencies beyond those required by the Autotools suite which is
used to build the package.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please refer to the INSTALL document.

BUGS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Please report bugs to chrisc.101@gmail.com. The ideal way of reporting a bug is
to find the minimal steps required to reproduce it, and to write a test to
demonstrate this. Failing that, please write a descriptive bug report including
the following:

  • what system you're running on
  • which version of t4 you are using
  • how to reproduce the bug

CONTRIBUTING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contributions are more than welcome. You can email me patches using
git-send-email (1), or you can create a remote branch on GitHub and ask me to
pull from that for more substantial changes. Ideally standalone patches should
be created using git format-patch since that makes it easiest to import the
patch with a commit message into a git repository.
